Artagnan of Kansas  by E  P  Lyle  Jr   the film was produced by and stars  Douglas Fairbanks   A now complete and restored print of the film still exists and is currently in the  public domain     1       The film opens with a sequence in which  D Artagnan   Douglas Fairbanks  rides up to a tavern on horseback and ends up brawling with sword and fist with the patrons inside in his haste to approach a fair young stranger  After triumphing  he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker  also played by Fairbanks      Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D Artagnan and   The Three Musketeers    despite his father s concern that it is not good for him  In fact  Ned does get into trouble with his  sometimes unwanted  chivalrous attempts to help women   Finally  Ned can stand it no more  he decides to leave dull Kansas  In mirroring scenes  D Artagnan is astride a somewhat less than noble steed  a present from his father for his departure from home  while Ned s father gives him the modern equivalent  a car     While driving in the desert  he comes upon a chauffeur driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away  Unimpressed with one passenger  the  middle aged Forrest Vandeteer  the  richest man in  Yonkers     Ned is quite taken with the lovely   Park Avenue   flapper   Elsie Dodge  Her mother  the third passenger  sees her only daughter s marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits  Vandeteer buys what he wants  and he wants Elsie  She  however  loathes her suitor  she much prefers young Ned     Ned comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks  He takes the party  with Elsie in the front seat beside him  to their  Grand Canyon  resort hotel  There  Vandeteer tells Ned to stay away from the ladies  John Blabb  who works for  Town Topics   informs Ned that Vandeteer already has three wives hidden away somewhere     Meanwhile  Chin de dah  the Native American leader of an outlaw gang hiding in a tributary canyon  is bored  He decides to kidnap a white woman to be his wife  his last  wife  is shown to have committed suicide   He goes to the resort  pretending to be a guide  and selects Elsie as his target  Ned is suspicious  but Vandeteer hires him  Vandeteer and Elsie set out for a horse ride down the canyon with their guide  Ned uses the time to persuade Mrs  Dodge that her daughter s happiness should take priority over their financial security     James Brown  a member of the gang who knows and hates Vandeteer  gleefully tells Ned about the man s impending demise and  Chin de dah s intentions toward Elsie  Ned shames him into helping with a rescue  They reach the camp in time to free Elsie and Vandeteer  but remain in peril  Vandeteer offers Ned  100 000 to save his life  Ned makes him put it in writing  Then they are lifted up the sheer cliff by a rope pulled by a horse  Once they are safe  Brown wants to kill Vandeteer  who falsely incriminated him in Vandeteer s own scam and stole his wife and children  Vandeteer ends up clinging to the cliffside  kept from falling to his death only by Ned s grip  Under Ned s direction  he writes a note exonerating Brown  Ned persuades Brown to let Vandeteer live  and promises to split the reward with him  Once they are alone  Elsie kisses her rescuer     Filming began in the fall of 1917 at the  Grand Canyon  in  Arizona   Additional scenes were shot at  Canyon de Chelly  near  Chinle  Arizona    2    and at the Jesse Lasky Studios in  Los Angeles      Like many American films of the time   A Modern Musketeer  was subject to cuts by  city and state film censorship boards   The Chicago Board of Censors required a cut of the two intertitles  The boss has gone for another woman  and  Remember the last woman   three scenes of young woman in cave including and following her suicide  and the shooting scene where a man falls    3       The majority of  A Modern Musketeer  was long presumed  lost  as only partial 35mm print of the film that Douglas Fairbanks donated to the  Museum of Modern Art  was known to exist  The missing footage was later discovered by the  Danish Film Institute   The DFI and the Museum of Modern Art restored the film with the newly discovered footage and the preserved print    4      5       The restored version of  A Modern Musketeer  was
