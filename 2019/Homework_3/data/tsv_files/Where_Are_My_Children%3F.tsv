American silent  drama film  directed by  Phillips Smalley  and  Lois Weber  and stars  Tyrone Power Sr   Juan de la Cruz  Helen Riaume   Marie Walcamp   Cora Drew  A D  Blake  Rene Rogers  William Haben and C  Norman Hammond     The film tells the story of a district attorney  Power Sr  who  while prosecuting a doctor for illegal  abortions   finds out that society people  including his wife  used the doctor s services     Richard Walton  a district attorney  is presented with an obscenity case  A medical practitioner  Dr  Homer  has been arrested for distributing  indecent  birth control literature  On the stand  Dr  Homer makes a strong case for legalizing contraception  He recounts three incidents from his medical practice  each shown in a brief flashback   children are exposed to violent abuse in a family riddled with alcoholism  an impoverished family is unable to provide adequate medical care for their sick children  and a single mother  abandoned by her male lover  commits suicide with her young infant     Meanwhile  Richard s wife  Edith  has been keeping a secret from him for many years  she has been seeing a doctor  one Herman Malfit  who performs abortions so that her busy social life will not be interrupted by the inconvenience of pregnancy  She suggests it as an option for her friend Mrs  William Carlo  who is with child  Mrs  Carlo has the abortion     The Waltons receive two new guests in their house almost simultaneously  Edith Walton s ne er do well younger brother  and their maid s young daughter  Lillian  Smitten by the brother s advances  the maid s daughter is seduced and soon finds herself pregnant  She is taken to Dr  Malfit and then abandoned by the boy after the operation goes wrong  Making her way back to the Walton mansion  she collapses and dies from the botched abortion     Following Malfit s arrest and trial  Richard Walton examines the doctor s ledgers and realized that his wife and many of her friends are listed as having received  personal services   He returns home  furious  to find them lunching at his home  He banishes his wife s friends  saying  I should bring you to trial for manslaughter   and confronts Edith with the cry   where are my children    She is overcome with remorse  As the years pass  the couple must contend with a lonely  childless life  full of longing for the family they might have had     The film was inspired by the obscenity case of  Margaret Sanger  in  New York   It stands as one of the best surviving examples of Lois Weber s social problem films      Eugenics  and  family planning  are discussed didactically in the film  and examples of desirable or undesirable children  the results of good or bad breeding respectively  are shown     While the film presents an argument for birth control  it takes a firm stance against abortion  portraying the wealthy women as procuring abortions on a whim when pregnancy threatens to interfere with their social lives  According to some critics  the film also portrays abortion inaccurately  suggesting that it is inherently harmful to patients both physically and mentally  At the time Weber made the film   back alley  and  illegal  abortions were prevalent and quite often resulted in destroying women s ability to have future children  It is left clear at the film s end Mrs  Walton can no longer have children because her body is damaged by a long term overindulgence in abortions     The film was written by  Lucy Payton   Franklin Hall   Lois Weber  and  Phillips Smalley   No director is credited  Future star  Mary MacLaren  made her debut in this film playing the Walton s younger maid  Shooting took place in the  Los Angeles  area  and at the Universal studio facilities in Hollywood  The Waltons are played by  Tyrone Power Sr  and Helen Riaume  who at the time were real life husband and wife  Anne Power  their daughter  has a small role     The film makes use of several trick photography scenes  with an emphasis on multiple exposures to convey information or emotions visually  This is especially evident in the final scene of the film  As a recurring motif  every time a character becomes pregnant  a child s face is double exposed over their shoulder     Weber returned to the topic of birth control the following year  with a film called   Hand That Rocks the Cradle    in which she plays the principal role of Louise Broome  a birth control advocate imprisoned for her work     The film was widely viewed in the U S  and made Lois Weber popular  It did well in  New York City  and in  Manhattan   after the film was allowed to be exhibited after a court case was dismissed  In  Atlantic City   the film played to packed houses  Critics praised the film for its delicate handling of sensitive subject matter and attention to detail and dramatic qualities  However  in  Pennsylvania   the film was banned  even after several edited submissions to the censors  They felt that it was filth and no amount of editing could make the film fit for decent people to see    1       In 1993  the film was selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant   A 2000 DVD release featured a reconstructed piano score written and performed by Martin Marks  A 2007 DVD release featured full orchestration of the Marks score  as arranged by Allen Feinstein  and expert audio commentary by film historian Shelley Stamp   A 2018 DVD Blu ray release featured a new piano score by Maud Nelissen    2
