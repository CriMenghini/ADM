    5    is an American  silent   epic   drama film  directed and co produced by  D  W  Griffith  and starring  Lillian Gish   The screenplay is adapted from the novel and play   The Clansman    by  Thomas Dixon Jr   Griffith co wrote the screenplay with  Frank E  Woods   and co produced the film with Harry Aitken  It was released on February 8  1915      The Birth of a Nation  is a landmark of film history    6      7    It was the first 12  reel  film ever made and  at three hours  also the longest up to that point    8    Its plot  part fiction and part history  chronicling the  assassination of Abraham Lincoln  by  John Wilkes Booth  and the relationship of two families in the  Civil War  and  Reconstruction  eras over the course of several years—the pro  Union   Northern  Stonemans and the pro  Confederacy   Southern  Camerons—was by far the most complex of any movie made up to that date  It was originally shown in two parts separated by another movie innovation  an intermission  and it was the first to have a musical score for an orchestra  It pioneered close ups  fade outs  and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of  extras   another first  made to look like thousands    9    It came with a 13 page  Souvenir Program     10    It was the first American motion picture to be screened in the  White House   viewed there by President  Woodrow Wilson      The film was controversial even before its release and has remained so ever since  it has been called  the most controversial film ever made in the United States     11      198   Lincoln  who Dixon saw as a Southerner    12    was portrayed positively  unusual in a   Lost Cause   environment  But it portrayed black men  many played by white actors in  blackface   as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women  It presented the  Ku Klux Klan   KKK  as a heroic force    13      14    There were widespread black protests against  The Birth of a Nation   such as in  Boston   while thousands of white Bostonians flocked to see the film    15    The  NAACP  spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to ban the film    15    Griffith s indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce   Intolerance   the following year    16       It was a huge commercial success and became highly influential  The film s release has also been acknowledged as an inspiration for  the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan  only months later  In 1992  the  Library of Congress  deemed the film  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant  and selected it for preservation in the  National Film Registry      The film consists of two parts of similar length  The first part closes with the  assassination of Abraham Lincoln   after which there is an  intermission   At the New York premiere  Dixon spoke on stage between the parts  reminding the audience that the dramatic version of  The Clansman  appeared in that venue nine years previously   Mr  Dixon also observed that he would have allowed none but the son of a Confederate soldier to direct the film version of  The Clansman      17       The film follows two  juxtaposed  families  One is the Northern Stonemans   abolitionist  U S  Representative Austin Stoneman  based on the Reconstruction era Representative  Thaddeus Stevens  of Pennsylvania     18      19    his daughter  and two sons  The other is the Southern Camerons  Dr  Cameron  his wife  their three sons and two daughters  Phil  the elder Stoneman son  falls in love with Margaret Cameron  during the brothers  visit to the Cameron estate in  South Carolina   representing the  Old South   Meanwhile  young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman  When the Civil War arrives  the young men of both families enlist in their respective armies  The younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in combat  Meanwhile  the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout a black militia  after an attack on the Cameron home  Ben Cameron leads a heroic charge at the  Siege of Petersburg   earning the nickname of  the Little Colonel   but he is also wounded and captured  He is then taken to a Union hospital in  Washington  D C      During his stay at the hospital  he is told that he will be hanged  Also at the hospital  he meets Elsie Stoneman  whose picture he has been carrying  she is working there as a nurse  Elsie takes Cameron s mother  who had traveled to Washington to tend her son  to see  Abraham Lincoln   and Mrs  Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben  When  Lincoln is assassinated  at  Ford s Theatre   his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him  In the wake of the president s death  Austin Stoneman and other  Radical Republicans  are determined to punish the South  employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the  Reconstruction Era     20       Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch  a  psychopathic   mulatto     21    head to  South Carolina  to observe the implementation of Reconstruction policies firsthand  During the election  in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor  blacks are observed  stuffing the ballot boxes   while  many whites are denied the vote   The newly elected  mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior  such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk  and others drinking liquor and feasting on  fried chicken      Meanwhile  inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children  Ben fights back by forming the  Ku Klux Klan   As a result  Elsie  out of loyalty to her father  breaks off her relationship with Ben  Later  Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus  a  freedman  and soldier who is now a captain  He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married  Frightened  she flees into the forest  pursued by Gus  Trapped on a precipice  Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer  When he does  she leaps to her death  Having run through the forest looking for her  Ben has seen her jump  he holds her as she dies  then carries her body back to the Cameron home  In response  the Klan hunts down Gus  tries him  finds him guilty  and  lynches  him     Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus s murder  He also secures the passing of legislation allowing  mixed race marriages   Dr  Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben s  Klan regalia   now considered a crime punishable by death  He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants  Together with Margaret Cameron  they flee  When their wagon breaks down  they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them  An  intertitle  states   The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their  Aryan  birthright     22       Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt  Gov  Lynch s crackdown  Elsie  learning of Dr  Cameron s arrest  goes to Lynch to plead for his release  Lynch  who had been lusting after Elsie  tries to force her to marry him  which causes her to faint  Stoneman returns  causing Elsie to be placed in another room   At first Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman  but he is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman s daughter  Undercover Klansman spies go to get help when they discover Elsie s plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help  Elsie falls unconscious again  and revives while gagged and being bound  The Klan gathered together  with Ben leading them  ride in to gain control of the town  When news about Elsie reaches Ben  he and others go to her rescue  Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help  Lynch is captured  Victorious  the Klansmen celebrate in the streets  Meanwhile  Lynch s militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding  The Klansmen  with Ben at their head  race in to save them just in time  The next election day  blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes  and are intimidated into not voting     The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron  The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away  The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of  Jesus Christ   The penultimate title is   Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more  But instead — the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace       Credited      Uncredited     It is little known  but there was an uncompleted  lost 1911 version  titled  The Clansman   It used  Kinemacolor  and a new sound process  and one reason for this version s failure is the unwillingness of theater owners to purchase the equipment to show it  Director was  William F  Haddock   producer was George Brennan  Some scenes were filmed on the porches and lawns of  Homewood Plantation   in  Natchez  Mississippi     23    One and a half reels were completed    24      330      Kinemacolor received a settlement from the producers of  Birth  when they proved that they had an earlier right to film the work    24      329      The footage was shown to the trade in an attempt to arouse interest  Early movie critic  Frank E  Woods  attended  Griffiths always credited Woods with bringing  The Clansman  to his attention    24      331      After the failure of the Kinemacolor project  in which Dixon was willing to invest his own money    24      330   he began visiting other studios to see if they were interested    25        page needed      In late 1913  Dixon met the film producer Harry Aitken  who was interested in making a film out of  The Clansman   and through Aitken  Dixon met Griffith    25        page needed      Like Dixon  Griffith was a Southerner  a fact that Dixon points out    26      295   Griffith s father served as a colonel in the  Confederate States Army  and  like Dixon  viewed Reconstruction negatively  Griffith believed that a passage from  The Clansman  where Klansmen ride  to the rescue of persecuted white Southerners  could be adapted into a great cinematic sequence    27        Birth of a Nation   follows  The Clansman   the play  nearly scene by scene     28      xvii   While some sources also credit  The Leopard s Spots  as source material  Russell Merritt attributes this to  the original 1915 playbills and program for  Birth  which  eager to flaunt the film s literary pedigree  cited both  The Clansman  and  The Leopard s Spots  as sources     29    According to Karen Crowe    t here is not a single event  word  character  or circumstance taken from  The Leopard s Spots      Any likenesses between the film and  The Leopard s Spots  occur because some similar scenes  circumstances  and characters appear in both books     28      xvii–xviii      Griffith agreed to pay Thomas Dixon  10 000  equivalent to  250 133 in 2018  for the rights to his play  The Clansman   Since he ran out of money and could afford only  2 500 of the original option  Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture  Dixon reluctantly agreed  and the unprecedented success of the film made him rich  Dixon s proceeds were the largest sum any author had received  up to 2007  for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars    30    The American historian  John Hope Franklin  suggested that many aspects of the script for  The Birth of a Nation  appeared to reflect Dixon s concerns more than Griffith s  as Dixon had an obsession in his novels of describing in loving detail the lynchings of black men  which did not reflect Griffith s interests    25      422–423      Griffith began  filming  in July 4  1914   31    and was finished by October 1914    25      421    D  W  Griffith  took over the Hollywood studio of Kinemacolor   West Point  engineers provided technical advice on the  American Civil War  battle scenes  providing Griffith with the artillery used in the film  Much of the filming was done on the  Griffith Ranch  in  San Fernando Valley     32      33       Griffith s budget started at US 40 000   30     equivalent to  990 000 in 2018  but rose to over  100 000   3     equivalent to  2 480 000 in 2018      By the time he finished filming  Griffith shot approximately 150 000 feet of footage  or about 36 hours worth of film   which he edited down to 13 000 feet  just over 3 hours     31       Although  The Birth of a Nation  is commonly regarded as a landmark for its dramatic and visual innovations  its use of music was arguably no less revolutionary    34    Though film was still silent at the time  it was common practice to distribute musical  cue sheets   or less commonly   full scores   usually for  organ  or  piano  accompaniment  along with each print of a film    35       For  The Birth of a Nation   composer  Joseph Carl Breil  created a three hour long musical score that combined all three types of music in use at the time  adaptations of existing works by classical composers  new arrangements of well known melodies  and original composed music    34    Though it had been specifically composed for the film  Breil s score was not used for the Los Angeles première of the film at  Clune s Auditorium   rather  a score compiled by Carli Elinor was performed in its stead  and this score was used exclusively in West Coast showings  Breil s score was not used until the film debuted in New York at the  Liberty Theatre   and was the score utilized in all showings save those on the West Coast    36      37       Outside of original compositions  Breil adapted classical music for use in the film  including passages from   Der Freischütz   by  Carl Maria von Weber     Leichte Kavallerie   by  Franz von Suppé    Symphony No  6  by  Ludwig van Beethoven   and   Ride of the Valkyries   by  Richard Wagner   the latter used as a  leitmotif  during the ride of the KKK    34    Breil also arranged several traditional and popular tunes that would have been recognizable to audiences at the time  including many Southern melodies  among these songs were   Maryland  My Maryland      Dixie      38      Old Folks at Home      The Star Spangled Banner      America the Beautiful      The Battle Hymn of the Republic      Auld Lang Syne    and   Where Did You Get That Hat       34      39     DJ Spooky  has called Breil s score  with its mix of  Dixieland  songs  classical music and  vernacular heartland music   an early  pivotal accomplishment in remix culture   He has also cited Breil s use of music by Richard Wagner as influential on subsequent Hollywood films  including   Star Wars    1977  and   Apocalypse Now    1979     40       In his original compositions for the film  Breil wrote numerous  leitmotifs  to accompany the appearance of specific characters  The principal love theme that was created for the romance between Elsie Stoneman and Ben Cameron was published as  The Perfect Song  and is regarded as the first marketed  theme song  from a film  it was later used as the theme song for the popular radio and television sitcom   Amos  n  Andy      36      37       The first public showing of the film  then called  The Clansman   was on January 1 and 2  1915  at the Loring Opera House in  Riverside  California     41    The second night  it was sold out and people were turned away    42    It was shown on February 8  1915  to an audience of 3 000 persons at  Clune s Auditorium  in downtown Los Angeles    43       The film s backers understood that the film needed a massive publicity campaign if they were to cover the immense cost of producing it  A major part of this campaign release the film in a  roadshow theatrical release   This allowed Griffith to charge premium prices for tickets  sell souvenirs  and build excitement around the film before giving it a  wide release   For several months  Griffith s team traveled to various cities to show the film for one or two nights before moving on  This strategy was immensely successful    31       The title was changed to  The Birth of a Nation  before the March 2 New York opening    24      329   However  Dixon copyrighted the title  The Birth of a Nation  in 1905    24      329   and it was used in the press as early as January 2  1915    44      45    while it was still referred to as  The Clansman  in October    46        Birth of a Nation  was the first movie shown in the  White House   in the  East Room   on February 18  1915    47     An earlier movie  the Italian   Cabiria    1914   was shown on the lawn   It was attended by  President Wilson   members of his family  and members of his  Cabinet     48    Both Dixon and Griffiths were present    49      126   As put by Dixon  not an impartial source   it repeated the triumph of the first showing     26      299      There is dispute about Wilson s attitude toward the movie  A newspaper reported that he  received many letters protesting against his alleged action in Indorsing the pictures     sic      including a letter from Massachusetts Representative  Thomas Thacher   whose term ended March 15     48    The showing of the movie had caused  several near riots     48    When Assistant Attorney General  William H  Lewis  and A  Walters  a bishop of the  African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church   called at the White House  to add their protests   Dr  Wilson s private secretary   Joseph Tumulty   showed them a letter he had written to Thacher on Wilson s behalf  According to the letter  Wilson had been  entirely unaware of the character of the play  movie  before it was presented  and has at no time expressed his approbation of it  Its exhibition at the White House was a courtesy extended to an old acquaintance     48    Dixon  in his autobiography  quotes Wilson as saying  when Dixon proposed showing the movie at the White House  that  I am pleased to be able to do this little thing for you  because a long time ago you took a day out of your busy life to do something for me     26      298   What Dixon had done for Wilson was to suggest him for an honorary degree  which Wilson received  from Dixon s   alma mater     Wake Forest College     50      512      Dixon had been a fellow graduate student in history with Wilson at  Johns Hopkins University   and in 1913 dedicated his historical novel about Lincoln   The Southerner   to  our first Southern born president since Lincoln  my friend and collegemate Woodrow Wilson      The evidence that Wilson knew  the character of the play  in advance of seeing it is circumstantial but very strong   Given Dixon s career and the notoriety attached to the play  The Clansman   it is not unreasonable to assume that Wilson must have had some idea of at least the general tenor of the film     50      513   The movie was based on a best selling novel and was preceded by a stage version  play  which was received with protests in several cities — in some cities it was prohibited — and received a great deal of news coverage  Wilson issued no protest when the  Evening Star   at that time Washington s  newspaper of record   reported in advance of the showing  in language suggesting a press release from Dixon and Griffiths  that Dixon was  a schoolmate of President Wilson and is an intimate friend   and that Wilson s interest in it  is due to the great lesson of peace it teaches     47    Wilson  and only Wilson  is quoted by name in the movie for his observations on American history  and the title of Wilson s book   History of the American People   is mentioned as well    50      518–519   The three  title cards  with quotations from Wilson s book read      Adventurers swarmed out of the North  as much the enemies of one race as of the other  to cozen  beguile and use the negroes      Ellipsis in the original   In the villages the negroes were the office holders  men who knew none of the uses of authority  except its insolences           The policy of the congressional leaders wrought…a veritable overthrow of civilization in the South     in their determination to   put the white South under the heel of the black South      Ellipses and underscore in the original       The white men were roused by a mere instinct of self preservation     until at last there had sprung into existence a great Ku Klux Klan  a veritable empire of the South  to protect the southern country    Ellipsis in the original      In the same book  Wilson has harsh words about the abyss between the original goals of the Klan and what it evolved into    51      52    Dixon has been accused of misquoting Wilson    50      518      In 1937 a popular magazine reported that Wilson said of the film   It is like writing history with lightning  And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true     53    Wilson over the years had several times used the metaphor of illuminating history as if by lightning and he may well have said it at the time  The accuracy of his saying it was  terribly true  is disputed by historians  there is no contemporary documentation of the remark    54      50      521      The next day  February 19  1915  Griffiths and Dixon held a showing of the film in the  Raleigh Hotel  ballroom  which they had hired for the occasion  Early that morning  Dixon called on a North Carolina friend  the white supremacist  Josephus Daniels    Secretary of the Navy   Daniels set up a meeting that morning for Dixon with  Edward Douglass White    Chief Justice of the Supreme Court   Initially Justice White was not interested in seeing the film  but when Dixon told him it was the  true story  of Reconstruction and the Klan s role in  saving the South   White  recalling his youth in Louisiana  jumped to attention and said   I was a member of the Klan  sir     55      171–172   With White agreeing to see the film  the rest of the Supreme Court followed  In addition to the entire Supreme Court  in the audience were  many members of Congress and members of the diplomatic corps     56      57    the Secretary of the Navy  38 members of the Senate  and about 50 members of the House of Representatives  The audience of 600  cheered and applauded throughout     58      25      425     59       In Griffith s words  the showings to the President and the entire Supreme Court conferred an  honor  upon  Birth of a Nation     50        page needed      Dixon and Griffiths used this commercially     The following day  Griffiths and Dixon transported the film to New York City for review by the  National Board of Censorship   They presented the film as  endorsed  by the President and the cream of Washington society  The Board approved the film by 15 to 8    60      127      A warrant to close the theater in which the movie was to open was dismissed after a long distance call to the White House confirmed that the film had been shown there    26      303     55      173      Justice White was very angry when advertising for the film stated that he approved it and he threatened to denounce it publicly    50      519      Dixon was clearly rattled and upset by criticism by African Americans that the movie encouraged hatred against them  and wanted the endorsement of many powerful men as possible to offset such criticism    25        page needed      Dixon always vehemently denied having anti black prejudices—despite the way his books promoted white supremacy—and stated   My books are hard reading for a Negro  and yet the Negroes  in denouncing them  are unwittingly denouncing one of their greatest friends     25      424      In a letter sent on May 1  1915  to Joseph P  Tumulty  Wilson s secretary  Dixon wrote   The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat     Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life     25      430   In a letter to President Wilson sent on September 5  1915  Dixon boasted   This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters  There will never be an issue of your segregation policy     25      430   Dixon was alluding to the fact that Wilson  upon becoming president in 1913  had allowed cabinet members to impose segregation on federal workplaces in Washington D C  by reducing the number of black employees through demotion or dismissal    61       One famous part of the film was added by Griffith only on the second run of the film   62    and is missing from most online versions of the film  presumably taken from first run prints     63       These are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film  The added titles read     A PLEA FOR THE ART OF THE MOTION PICTURE      We do not fear censorship  for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities  but we do demand  as a right  the liberty to show the dark side of wrong  that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue – the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word – that art to which we owe the Bible and the works of Shakespeare   and    If in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence  this effort will not have been in vain    Various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles  To Nicholas Andrew Miller  this shows that  Griffith s greatest achievement in  The Birth of a Nation  was that he brought the cinema s capacity for spectacle    under the rein of an outdated  but comfortably literary form of historical narrative  Griffith s models    are not the pioneers of film spectacle    but the giants of literary narrative     64    On the other hand  S  Kittrell Rushing complains about Griffith s  didactic  title cards    65    while Stanley Corkin complains that Griffith  masks his idea of fact in the rhetoric of high art and free expression  and creates film which  erodes the very ideal  of liberty which he asserts    66       The  New York Times  gave it a quite brief review  calling it  melodramatic  and  inflamatory   adding that   A great deal might be said concerning the spirit revealed in Mr  Dixon s review of the unhappy chapter of Reconstruction and concerning the sorry service rendered by its plucking at old wounds     67       The box office gross of  The Birth of a Nation  is not known  and has been the subject of exaggeration    68    When the film opened  the tickets were sold at premium prices  The film played at the  Liberty Theater  in  New York City  for 44 weeks with tickets priced at  2 20  equivalent to  54 in 2018     69    By the end of 1917  Epoch reported to its shareholders cumulative receipts of  4 8 million    70    and Griffith s own records put Epoch s worldwide earnings from the film at  5 2 million as of 1919    71    although the distributor s share of the revenue at this time was much lower than the exhibition gross  In the biggest cities  Epoch negotiated with individual theater owners for a percentage of the box office  elsewhere  the producer sold all rights in a particular state to a single distributor  an arrangement known as  state s rights  distribution     72    The film historian  Richard Schickel  says that under the state s rights contracts  Epoch typically received about 10  of the box office gross—which theater owners often underreported—and concludes that   Birth  certainly generated more than  60 million in box office business in its first run     70       The film held the mantle of the  highest grossing film  until it was overtaken by   Gone with the Wind    1939   another film about the Civil War and Reconstruction era    73      74     By 1940   Time   magazine estimated the film s cumulative  gross rental   the distributor s earnings  at approximately  15 million    75    For years   Variety   had the gross rental listed as  50 million  but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to  5 million    70    It is not known for sure how much the film has earned in total  but producer Harry Aitken put its estimated earnings at  15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version    71    It is likely the film earned over  20 million for its backers  and generated  50–100 million in box office receipts    4     In a 2015  Time  article   Richard Corliss  estimated the film had earned the equivalent of  1 8 billion adjusted for  inflation   a milestone that at the time had only been surpassed by   Titanic    1997  and   Avatar    2009  in  nominal  earnings    76       Like Dixon s novels and play   Birth of a Nation  received considerable criticism  both before and after its premiere  Dixon  who believed it entirely truthful  attributed this to  Sectionalists   i e  non Southerners who in Dixon s opinion were hostile to the truth about the South    26      301  303   It was to counter these  sinister forces  and the  dangerous   menace  that Dixon and Griffiths sought  the backing  of President Wilson and the Supreme Court    26      296      The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People   NAACP  protested at premieres of the film in numerous cities  According to the historian David Copeland   by the time of the movie s March 3  1915  premiere in New York City  its subject matter had embroiled the film in charges of racism  protests  and calls for  censorship   which began after the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP requested the city s film board ban the movie  Since film boards were composed almost entirely of whites  few review boards initially banned Griffith s picture     77    The NAACP also conducted a public education campaign  publishing articles protesting the film s fabrications and inaccuracies  organizing petitions against it  and conducting education on the facts of the war and Reconstruction    78    Because of the lack of success in NAACP s actions to ban the film  on April 17  1915  NAACP secretary  Mary Childs Nerney  wrote to NAACP Executive Committee member George Packard   I am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to  The Birth of a Nation      kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort of this thing and have gotten nowhere     79        Jane Addams   an American social worker and social reformer  and the founder of  Hull House   voiced her reaction to the film in an interview published by the   New York Post   on March 13  1915  just ten days after the film was released    80    She stated that  One of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago  which have nothing to do with the facts we have to consider to day  Even then it does not tell the whole truth  It is claimed that the play is historical  but history is easy to misuse     80    In New York  Rabbi  Stephen Samuel Wise  told the press after seeing  The Birth of a Nation  that the film was  an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings     25      426   In Boston   Booker T  Washington  wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film    25      426   while the civil rights activist  William Monroe Trotter  organized demonstrations against the film  which he predicted was going to worsen race relations  On Saturday  April 10  and again on April 17  Trotter and a group of other blacks tried to buy tickets for the show s premiere at the Tremont Theater and were refused  They stormed the box office in protest  260 police on standby rushed in  and a general melee ensued  Trotter and ten others were arrested    81    The following day a huge demonstration was staged at  Faneuil Hall     15      82    In Washington D C  the Reverend  Francis James Grimké  published a pamphlet entitled  Fighting a Vicious Film  that challenged the historical accuracy of  The Birth of a Nation  on a scene by scene basis    25      427   When the film was released  riots also broke out in  Philadelphia  and other major cities in the United States  The film s inflammatory nature was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks  On April 24  1916  the   Chicago American   reported that a white man murdered a black teenager in  Lafayette  Indiana   after seeing the film  although there has been some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen  The Birth of a Nation     83    The mayor of  Cedar Rapids  Iowa  was the first of twelve mayors to ban the film in 1915 out of concern that it would promote race prejudice  after meeting with a delegation of black citizens    84    The NAACP set up a precedent setting national boycott of the film  likely seen as the most successful effort  Additionally  they organized a mass demonstration when the film was screened in Boston  and it was banned in three states and several cities    85       Both Griffith and Dixon in letters to the press dismissed African American protests against  The Birth of a Nation     86    In a letter to   The New York Globe    Griffith wrote that his film was  an influence against the intermarriage of blacks and whites     86    Dixon likewise called the NAACP  the Negro Intermarriage Society  and said it was against  The Birth of a Nation   for one reason only—because it opposes the marriage of blacks to whites     86    Griffith—indignant at the film s negative critical reception—wrote letters to newspapers and published a pamphlet in which he accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions    87       When Sherwin Lewis of  The New York Globe  wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film s distorted portrayal of history  and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few  dirty dollars   Griffith responded that  the public should not be afraid to accept the truth  even though it might not like it   He also added that the man who wrote the editorial was  damaging my reputation as a producer  and  a liar and a coward     41        The Birth of a Nation  was very popular  despite the film s controversy  it was unlike anything that American audiences had ever seen before    89    The  Los Angeles Times  called it  the greatest picture ever made and the greatest drama ever filmed     90     Mary Pickford  said    Birth of a Nation  was the first picture that really made people take the motion picture industry seriously     91    It became a national cultural phenomenon  merchandisers made Ku Klux hats and kitchen aprons  and ushers dressed in white Klan robes for openings  In New York there were Klan themed balls  and in Chicago that Halloween  thousands of college students dressed in robes for a massive Klan themed party    92    The producers had 15  detectives  at the  Liberty Theater  in  New York City   to prevent disorder on the part of those who resent the  reconstruction period  episodes depicted     93       The Reverend  Charles Henry Parkhurst  defended the film against the charge of racism by saying that it  was exactly true to history  by depicting freedmen as they were  and therefore it was a  compliment to the black man  by showing how far black people had  advanced  since Reconstruction    88    Critic Dolly Dalrymple wrote that   when I saw it  it was far from silent     incessant murmurs of approval  roars of laughter  gasps of anxiety  and outbursts of applause greeted every new picture on the screen     94    One man viewing the film was so moved by the scene where Flora Cameron flees Gus to avoid being raped that he took out his handgun and began firing at the screen in an effort to help her    94     Katharine DuPre Lumpkin  recalled watching the film as an 18 year old in 1915 in her 1947 autobiography  The Making of a Southerner    Here was the black figure—and the fear of the white girl—though the scene blanked out just in time  Here were the sinister men the South scorned and the noble men the South revered  And through it all the Klan rode  All around me people sighed and shivered  and now and then shouted or wept  in their intensity     95       D  W  Griffith made a film in 1916  called   Intolerance    partly in response to the criticism that  The Birth of a Nation  received  Griffith made clear within numerous interviews that the film s title and main themes were chosen in response to those who he felt had been intolerant to  The Birth of a Nation     96    A sequel called   The Fall of a Nation   was released in 1916  It was the first sequel in film history    97    The film was directed by Thomas Dixon Jr   who adapted it from  his novel of the same name   Despite its success in the foreign market  the film was not a success among American audiences    11      102   and is now a  lost film     98       In 1918  an American silent drama film directed by  John W  Noble  called   The Birth of a Race   was released as a direct response to  The Birth of a Nation     99    The film was an ambitious project by producer  Emmett Jay Scott  to challenge Griffith s film and tell another side of the story  but was ultimately unsuccessful    100    In 1920  African American filmmaker  Oscar Micheaux  released   Within Our Gates    a response to  The Birth of a Nation    Within Our Gates  depicts the hardships faced by African Americans during the era of  Jim Crow laws     101    Griffith s film was remixed in 2004 as  Rebirth of a Nation  by DJ Spooky    102     Quentin Tarantino  has said that he made his film   Django Unchained    2012  to counter the falsehoods of  The Birth of a Nation     103       In November 1915   William Joseph Simmons  revived the Klan in Atlanta  Georgia    25      430   The historian John Hope Franklin observed that  had it not been for  The Birth of a Nation   the Klan might not have been reborn    25      430–431      Franklin wrote in 1979 that  The influence of  Birth of a Nation  on the current view of  Reconstruction  has been greater than any other single force   but that  It is not at all difficult to find inaccuracies and distortions  in the movie    25      433  427      Released in 1915   The Birth of a Nation  has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film  According to the film historian  Kevin Brownlow   the film was  astounding in its time  and initiated  so many advances in film making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years     104    The content of the work  however  has received widespread criticism for its blatant racism  Film critic Roger Ebert wrote     Certainly  The Birth of a Nation   1915  presents a challenge for modern audiences  Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history  they find it quaint and not to their taste  Those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant  but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes  which are racist in the ham handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet    105       Despite its controversial story  the film has been praised by film critics  with Ebert mentioning its use as a historical tool    The Birth of a Nation  is not a bad film because it argues for evil  Like  Riefenstahl  s   Triumph of the Will    it is a great film that argues for evil  To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film  and even something about evil     105       According to a 2002 article in the   Los Angeles Times    the film facilitated the refounding of the Ku Klux Klan in 1915    106     History com  similarly states that  There is no doubt that  Birth of a Nation  played no small part in winning wide public acceptance  for the KKK  and that throughout the film  African Americans are portrayed as brutish  lazy  morally degenerate  and dangerous     107     David Duke  used the film to recruit Klansmen in the 1970s    108       In 2013  the American critic  Richard Brody  wrote  The Birth of a Nation  was         a seminal commercial spectacle but also a decisively original work of art—in effect  the founding work of cinematic realism  albeit a work that was developed to pass lies off as reality  It s tempting to think of the film s influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode—but it s even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty  on the one hand  and  on the other  its injustice and falsehood  The movie s fabricated events shouldn t lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction  But they also shouldn t lead to a denial of the peculiar  disturbingly exalted beauty of  Birth of a Nation   even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda  The worst thing about  The Birth of a Nation  is how good it is  The merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and  despite its disgusting content  also make it hard not to love  And it s that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable  the experience of the film more of a torment—together with the acknowledgment that Griffith  whose short films for Biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema  yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred  which  still worse  he sincerely depicted as virtuous     103      Brody also argued that Griffith unintentionally undercut his own thesis in the film  citing the scene before the Civil War when the Cameron family offers up lavish hospitality to the Stoneman family who travel past mile after mile of slaves working the cotton fields of South Carolina to reach the Cameron home maintaining that a modern audience can see that the wealth of the Camerons comes from the slaves forced to do back breaking work picking the cotton  Likewise  Brody argued that the scene where people in South Carolina celebrate the Confederate victory at the Battle of Bull Run by dancing around the  eerie flare of a bonfire  which imply  a dance of death   foreshadowing the destruction of  Sherman s March  that was to come  In the same way  Brody wrote that the scene where the Klan dumps Gus s body off at the doorstep of Lynch is meant to have the audience cheering  but modern audiences find the scene  obscene and horrifying   Finally  Brody argued that the end of the film  where the Klan prevents defenseless African Americans from exercising their right to vote by pointing guns at them  today seems  unjust and cruel     103       In an article for   The Atlantic    film critic  Ty Burr  deemed  The Birth of a Nation  the most influential film in history while criticizing its portrayal of black men as savage    109    Richard Corliss of  Time  wrote that Griffith  established in the hundreds of one  and two reelers he directed a cinematic textbook  a fully formed visual language  for the generations that followed  More than anyone else—more than all others combined—he invented the film art  He brought it to fruition in  The Birth of a Nation    Corliss praised the film s  brilliant storytelling technique  and noted that   The Birth of a Nation  is nearly as antiwar as it is antiblack  The Civil War scenes  which consume only 30 minutes of the extravaganza  emphasize not the national glory but the human cost of combat      Griffith may have been a racist politically  but his refusal to find uplift in the South s war against the Union—and  implicitly  in any war at all—reveals him as a cinematic humanist     76       In 1992  the U S   Library of Congress  deemed the film  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant  and selected it for preservation in the  National Film Registry    The  American Film Institute  recognized the film by ranking it  44 within the  AFI s 100 Years   100 Movies  list in 1998     The film remains controversial due to its interpretation of American history   University of Houston  historian Steven Mintz summarizes its message as follows    Reconstruction  was an unmitigated disaster  blacks could never be  integrated  into white society as equals  and the violent actions of the Ku Klux Klan were justified to reestablish honest government     110    The South is portrayed as a victim  The first overt mentioning of the war is the scene in which Abraham Lincoln signs the call for the first 75 000 volunteers  However  the first aggression in the Civil War  made when the Confederate troops fired on  Fort Sumter  in 1861  is not mentioned in the film    111     The film suggested that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the postwar South  which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists  freedmen  and  carpetbagging   Republican  politicians from the North  This reflects the so called  Dunning School  of historiography    112    The film is slightly less extreme than the books upon which it is based  in which Dixon misrepresented Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok  storming into weddings to rape white women with impunity    95       The film portrayed President  Abraham Lincoln  as a friend of the  Confederacy   and refers to him as  the Great Heart     113    The two romances depicted in the film  Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman  reflect Griffith s retelling of history  The couples are used as a metaphor  representing the film s broader message of the need for the reconciliation of the North and South to defend white supremacy    114    Among both couples  there is an attraction that forms before the war  stemming from the friendship between their families   With the war  however  both families are split apart  and their losses culminate in the end of the war with the defense of white supremacy   One of the intertitles clearly sums up the message of unity   The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright     115       The film further reinforced the popular belief held by whites  especially in the South  of Reconstruction as a disaster  In his 1929 book  The Tragic Era  The Revolution After Lincoln   the respected historian  Claude Bowers  treated  The Birth of a Nation  as a factually accurate account of Reconstruction    25      432   In  The Tragic Era   Bowers presented every black politician in the South as corrupt  portrayed Republican Representative  Thaddeus Stevens  as a vicious   race traitor   intent upon making blacks the equal of whites  and praised the Klan for  saving civilization  in the South    25      432   Bowers wrote about black empowerment that the worst sort of  scum  from the North like Stevens  inflamed the Negro s egoism and soon the lustful assaults began  Rape was the foul daughter of Reconstruction     25      432      The American historian  John Hope Franklin  wrote that not only did Claude Bowers treat  The Birth of a Nation  as accurate history  but his version of history seemed to be drawn from  The Birth of a Nation     25      432   Some historians  such as  E  Merton Coulter  in his  The South Under Reconstruction   1947   maintained the Dunning School view after World War II  Today  the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti black racism of the early 20th century  by which many white Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens  Coulter in  The South During Reconstruction   which again treated  The Birth of a Nation  as historically correct  and painted a vivid picture of  black beasts  running amok  encouraged by alcohol sodden  corrupt and vengeful black Republican politicians    25      432   Franklin wrote that as recently as the 1970s that the popular journalist  Alistair Cooke  in his books and TV shows was still essentially following the version of history set out by  The Birth of a Nation   noting that Cooke had much sympathy with the suffering of whites in Reconstruction while having almost nothing to say about the suffering of blacks or about how blacks were stripped of almost all their rights after 1877    25      432      Veteran film reviewer  Roger Ebert  wrote         stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its brutal images of blacks  Griffith tried to make amends in  Intolerance   1916   which criticized prejudice  And in   Broken Blossoms   he told perhaps the first  interracial love  story in the movies—even though  to be sure  it s an idealized love with no touching    116      Despite some similarities between the Congressman Stoneman character and Rep  Thaddeus Stevens of  Pennsylvania   Rep  Stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to South Carolina during Reconstruction  He died in Washington  D C  in 1868  However  Stevens  biracial housekeeper   Lydia Hamilton Smith   was considered his common law wife  and generously provided for in his will    117       In the film  Abraham Lincoln is portrayed in a positive light due to his belief in conciliatory postwar policies towards Southern whites  The president s views are opposite those of Austin Stoneman  a character presented in a negative light  who acts as an antagonist  The assassination of Lincoln marks the transition from war to Reconstruction  each of which periods has one of the two  acts  of the film    118    In including the assassination  the film also establishes to the audience that the plot of the movie has historical basis    119    Franklin wrote the film s depiction of Reconstruction as a hellish time when black freedmen ran amok  raping and killing whites with impunity until the Klan stepped in is not supported by the facts    25      427–428   Franklin wrote that most freed slaves continued to work for their former masters in Reconstruction for the want of a better alternative  and though relations between freedmen and their former masters were not friendly  very few freedmen sought revenge against the people who had enslaved them    25      427   The character of Silas Lynch has no basis in fact  and during the Reconstruction no black or mulatto men served as the lieutenant governor of South Carolina    25      427–428      The depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents  although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all black portion of the state militia under various justifications  prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention  and the organized Klan s continued activities as small groups of  night riders     120       The  civil rights movement  and other social movements created a new generation of historians  such as scholar  Eric Foner   who led a reassessment of Reconstruction  Building on  W  E  B  DuBois  work  but also adding new sources  they focused on achievements of the African American and white Republican coalitions  such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of  suffrage  to black men  In response  the Southern dominated  Democratic Party  and its affiliated white militias had used extensive terrorism  intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress African American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power    121       In his review of  The Birth of a Nation  in   1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die    Jonathan Kline writes that  with countless artistic innovations  Griffith essentially created contemporary film language     virtually every film is beholden to   The Birth of a Nation   in one way  shape or form  Griffith introduced the use of dramatic close ups  tracking shots  and other expressive camera movements  parallel action sequences  crosscutting  and other editing techniques   He added that  the fact that  The Birth of a Nation  remains respected and studied to this day despite its subject matter reveals its lasting importance     122       Griffith pioneered such camera techniques as close ups  fade outs  and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands    123     The Birth of a Nation  also contained many new artistic techniques  such as color tinting for dramatic purposes  building up the plot to an exciting climax  dramatizing history alongside fiction  and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra    30       For many years   The Birth of a Nation  was poorly represented in home media and restorations   This stemmed from several factors  one of which was the fact that Griffith and others had frequently reworked the film  leaving no definitive version   According to the silent film website  Brenton Film   many home media releases of the film consisted of  poor quality DVDs with different edits  scores  running speeds and usually in  definitely unoriginal  black and white     124       One of the earliest high quality home versions was film preservationist  David Shepard  s 1992 transfer of a  16mm  print for VHS and laserdisc release via  Image Entertainment   A short documentary   The Making of The Birth of a Nation   newly produced and narrated by Shepard  was also included  Both were released on DVD by Image in 1998 and the UK s Eureka Entertainment in 2000    124       In the UK   Photoplay Productions  restored the  Museum of Modern Art  s  35mm  print that was the source of Shepard s 16 mm print  though they also augmented it with extra material from the  British Film Institute   It was also given a full orchestral recording of the original Breil score  Though broadcast on  Channel 4  television and theatrically screened many times  Photoplay s 1993 version was never released on home video    124       Shepard s transfer and documentary were reissued in the US by  Kino Video  in 2002  this time in a 2 DVD set with added extras on the second disc  These included several Civil War shorts also directed by D  W  Griffith    124    In 2011  Kino prepared a HD transfer of a 35 mm negative from the Paul Killiam Collection  They added some material from the  Library of Congress  and gave it a new compilation score  This version was released on Blu ray by Kino in the US  Eureka in the UK  as part of their   Masters of Cinema   collection  and Divisa Home Video in Spain    124       In 2015  the year of the film s centenary   Photoplay Productions    Patrick Stanbury   in conjunction with the  British Film Institute   carried out the first full restoration  It mostly used new  4K  scans of the LoC s original camera negative  along with other early generation material  It  too  was given the original Breil score and featured the film s original tinting for the first time since its 1915 release  The restoration was released on a 2 Blu ray set by the BFI  alongside a host of extras  including many other newly restored Civil War related films from the period    124       I ve reclaimed this title and re purposed it as a tool to challenge racism and white supremacy in America  to inspire a riotous disposition toward any and all injustice in this country  and abroad  and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change    128
