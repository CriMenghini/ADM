# Algorithms for Data Mining 

Hi everyone,
here you find the homeworks of ADM class of the MSc in Data Science @ La Sapienza University. For each years you find the respective assignments.

In particular, for each assignment, you find a sub directory that contains:

- `README.md` that describes the task, the deadline and the deliverables. You can also find the needed forms for the delivery!


## Take a look at
- `EVALUATION.md`: how peer evaluation works
- `DELIVERY.md`: submitting policy



## Collaborations
According to the policy presented by Aris, we encourage you to ask questions to your colleagues before coming to TAs office hours. As you did for homework 1, __Slack__ is a powerful mean to have an answer to your questions, so use it! Remember that partecipate to a debate is always a good way to practise.

## Office hours
Due to the fact that some of TAs work remotely and that you will have classes at Castro Laurenziano, TAs will not have office hours. Nonetheless, we will be always available on Slack to answer any of your question and, if you are struggling and having lot of troubles with the homework, you ask on Slack to organize office hours for the entire class and this will be set up at gazebos at DIAG, via Ariosto 25. During the office hours TAs will answer your questions and will make clarifications about parts of the homework that do not sound clear to you.
