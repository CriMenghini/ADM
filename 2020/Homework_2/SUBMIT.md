# Submit the homework

In this section you find the instruction to submit your group assignment.

## When?
Homework 2 is due on [9th November 2020 - 23:59:59](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2020). Any homework submitted after the deadline will be subjected to a penalisation with the following schema:

|   Delay  | Penalisation |
|:--------:|:------------:|
|  1 day |     -0.5     |
| 2 days |      -1      |
| 3 days |      -2      |
| 4 days |      -3      |
| 5 days |      -4      |

If you have particular problems to respect the deadline, please contact Aris directly (putting @Cristina in cc) and explain your situation clearly mention your working group.


The maximum score you can get is 5.

## Where?
1. Each group must create __only one__ GitHub repository: follow these [steps](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-HW4/blob/master/README.md) (replace ADM-HW4 with the name you give to the repository). 

2. Before the deadline you can push in the repository whatever you want. Any push after the deadline will be taken into account for the penalisation.

__Note__ :

* The state of the repository at deadline time corresponds to your submission.
* __[IMPORTANT]__ be sure to compile this ([submissission will be opened soon]()).

## What?

The content of the repository is up to you. The mandatory files are:

* `README.md`: a Markdown file that explains the content of your repository. This is an [example](https://github.com/CriMenghini/Wikipedia/tree/master/Mention). It is important that for each file/folder you say what it contains. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) a cheatsheet to use Markdown.

* `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook that contains all the answers to your exercises __about the football part__. The notebook must be clear, complete and tidy. [Here](https://github.com/dusicastepic/ADMSecondHomework/blob/master/ADM_HW2_Full.ipynb) an example of a nice notebook from last year.


## Post Homework

Each member of the team will need to fill other 2 forms, that will be published after the deadline of the homework:

1. [Individual Feedback (to be opened)](): a form to express how you worked with your group, and who did what.
2. [Peer Review (to be opened)](): you will receive an email, containing an homework that you have to review. You will find the guidelines of the review in the form.

You will have __5 days (120 hours)__ to fill the two forms. They are __mandatory__, i.e. we will not grade your homework if you won't fill all the forms.
